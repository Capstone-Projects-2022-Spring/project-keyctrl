### Jason, Colin, Melanie Hamilton, Andy, Alex, Li, Abdul

KeyCTRL is a web application where users can test their typing skills, track their improvement, and race against their friends to see who types the fastest. There are a wide variety of typing websites available that achieve one of these core aspects. However, there are few websites that provide this amount of typing options and features. The goal of KeyCTRL is to provide a “one-stop shop” for people to enjoy typing both the train and to have fun.
